0. Multiple mains

In most projects, we often provide you with only one main file to test. For instance, consider this main file that tests a positive_or_negative() function, similar to the one you previously worked on in a C project:

1. Like, comment, subscribe

Duplicate this main file. To resolve the issue causing the output to enter an infinite loop, comment out the problematic part of the code. Make sure not to delete any lines of code, as we will be verifying your line count. You are permitted to comment out existing code only. You do not need to compile with -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic for this task.

2. 0 > 972?

This program displays the largest among three integers.

3. Leap year

This program converts a given date to the corresponding day of the year and determines the number of days remaining in the year, considering leap years.
